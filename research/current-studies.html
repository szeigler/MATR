<h1>MATR + RESEARCH</h1>

<h2>Current Studies</h2>

<p>Twins needed! The following list of studies is actively recruiting twins to participate in their research. If you are interested, please contact the MATR for more information!</p>

<h3>Juvenile Anxiety Study (JAS) Update</h3>

<p>For the past year or so, the MATR has partnered with VCU researchers, Drs. John Hettema and Roxann Roberson-Nay to help understand the development of internalizing disorders, such as depression and anxiety.  Internalizing disorders (IDs) can greatly reduce the quality of life of the individuals that are affected by them as well as their family and friends.  Very little is known about why some individuals develop IDs and others do not.  The MATR is currently inviting families with twins ages 9 through 13 years old to participate.  Studying twins in this age range is helpful because it allows the researchers to observe behaviors and collect basic data during a time of significant adolescent development, but before internalizing disorders are likely to be fully developed.  The researchers are inviting twin pairs with and without signs of behaviors related to IDs to participate so they can learn more about the potential causes of these disorders. This study has the potential to not only provide a deeper understanding of the causes, but also to pioneer new ways in which doctors attempt to treat and prevent conditions like depression and anxiety.</p>

<p>We are pleased with the willingness of families who have agreed to participate—over 100 families have signed up so far!  Thank you so much to those who are a part of this study and have completed their study appointments!! We are looking forward to more families taking part because if a large number of families participate in this study, the researchers can make stronger conclusions about what influences the development of IDs.  And, it’s these strong conclusions that allow the medical community to start new treatments and interventions to help improve the quality of life for those with depression and anxiety.  If you’re interested in learning more about participating in this study be sure to review the <em>Juvenile Anxiety Study</em> advertisement in this newsletter.  For those of you with twin pairs a bit further along in their teenage years, please check our announcement about the <em>Adolescent and Young Adult Twin Study</em> (AYATS).</p>

<h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis Screener </h3>

<p>The MATR is currently conducting a phone screener to identify adult twin pairs in which at least one member of a pair suffers from  rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful health condition that affects approximately 1.3  million people in the United States. Unfortunately, little is known about the causes of RA so researchers  from New York University’s Hospital for Joint Disease  have teamed with the MATR in hopes of learning more about RA, its causes and  progression.  To date, very few twin  studies have been completed to investigate why some develop this oftentimes  debilitating condition. Twin studies are  helpful when looking at health conditions because they frequently help shed  light on the gene--environment interactions that play a role in disease expression and progression. In order to determine the feasibility of conducting a twin study to further investigate RA, the MATR is contacting adult  pairs of either zygosity (identical or fraternal). Currently, we are focusing our initial screening  efforts on twins that may have indicated on previous MATR surveys that they or  a family member have some form of arthritis. Thus far, we’ve screened over 200  adult twins in the Registry, so we’re halfway to our screening goal of 400  twins.  Thank you to those who have  already participated in this important screener call!</p>

<h3>Skin pigmentation, health care outcomes, and political attitudes.</h3>

<p>The MATR has started a new collaboration with Donald Green, PhD from Columbia University. Dr. Green and his colleagues hope to learn more about the differences and similarities between twins in terms of their health care, skin health, skin tone, sun exposure, and political attitudes. The goal of this study is to improve understanding about the possible impact environmental and genetic factors have on people’s skin health, health care, and attitudes. Dr. Green and his colleagues hope that the results of this study will help create policies that improve people’s health and wellbeing.</p>
  
<h3>Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry Survey</h3>
<p>Available to all interested adult MATR participants!</p>

<p><em>What is it?</em><br/>
The MATR has launched a new survey which will enrich our Registry as a potential resource for researchers.  This survey will ask questions about your health habits, health conditions and demographic characteristics.  It will also ask questions about your personality as well as your social and political attitudes.</p>

<p><em>How is this different from other MATR surveys?</em><br/>
For the first time we will be offering the option of taking this survey online!  The survey and data will be housed on a secure server and you only need internet access to complete the survey.</p>

<p><em>How do I get involved?</em><br/>
To participate, you need to be a registered, adult twin (over 18) or other multiple in our Registry (if you're not yet registered but want to participate, feel free to contact us to register!).  You can let us know you're interested in participating in the survey by sending us an email or calling us at 1-800-URA-TWIN and leaving a message for us on our voicemail. You can also click <a href="http://www.matr.vcu.edu/research/participate-now.html">HERE</a> to tell us you're interested. Feel free to let us know if you have any questions. Remember, as with all MATR related activities, participation is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Plus, you do not have to answer any question that you're not comfortable answering!</p>

<p><em>How will my participation help?</em><br/>
Though you may not benefit directly from taking part, your participation will hopefully result in improving our understanding of certain health conditions and behaviors.  We hope that with this improved understanding the scientific community will be better equipped to develop enhanced prevention methods and treatment plans.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis Studies</h2>

<p>The following studies are no longer actively recruiting, but are currently in the data analysis phase.  A big thanks to all the twins who participated!</p>

<h3>The  vaginal microbiome: disease, genetics, and the environment.</h3>

<p><em>(This study is part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP))</em></p>

<p>Our bodies carry around trillions of microbes--bacteria, viruses, and other living  things so tiny that we need a powerful microscope to see them. These microbes  live in groups in many places on and inside our bodies, such as the skin, the  mouth, nose, gut and (in women) the vagina. While we still don’t know how they  do it, many of these microbes help to keep us healthy, while others contribute  to disease. Similarly, changes in our health can affect our microbes. So can  things like where we live or work, our age, ancestry, health status, and  diet—and probably many other things that we don’t know about yet.</p>

<p>People and microbes both have DNA, the material that contains genetic  instructions. The microbes’ DNA affects how they live with each other and how  they act in our bodies. Our own DNA affects how we react to our microbes. All  of the different kinds of microbes that live on and inside us, taken together,  are called the “human microbiome.” The purpose of the HMP study is to learn  about the human microbiome by studying the microbes’ DNA, other chemicals that  the microbes produce, human DNA, and how microbes interact with each other and  with their human host to contribute to health and disease.</p>

<p>In this particular study we will focus just on the microbes that live in  specific parts of the body: the mouth, vagina, and perianal region. We will  collect samples from these areas; some from people who have certain diseases as  well as from people who do not. By comparing the microbes that we find in these  two sets of samples, and by making the information that we learn available to  other research scientists, we will gradually begin to understand more about the  complicated relationships between the microbes that live in these areas of the  body and certain diseases.</p>

<p>The  MATR is currently inviting identical and fraternal female twin pairs ages 18  and over who are willing to travel to the Stony Point Women’s Health Center  in Richmond, Virginia to participate in this study. Future studies that build on this research will help us to understand even more  about how the human microbiome affects human health more generally.</p>

<h3>Genes Environment and Development Initiative (GEDI)</h3>

<p>The first phase for Drs. Eaves’ and Silberg’s "Genes, Environment and the  Development of Substance Use" study is almost complete. This study is  part of a multi-site project called the Genes, Environment and Development  Initiative (GEDI) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Participants from several study sites, including the MATR, have provided  samples from which genetic material will be analyzed.</p>

<p>Investigators  will conduct "genotyping" (determining the genetic make up) of the samples  they’ve received for their analysis. Through their analysis the  researchers are hoping to determine which genes and/or combination of genes  most likely play a role in whether or not an individual may develop substance  use issues. There is also evidence to suggest that at different  developmental periods (childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood) there are  differing likelihoods that an individual might develop substance use  issues. Keeping this in mind, ultimately the researchers hope to answer <em>which </em>genes, <em>which</em> environments, and <em>which</em> developmental  transitions together predict the start and progression for <em>which</em> type of drug abuse  an individual might be susceptible to. While this research will take  several years to complete, in the end we hope to gain a better understanding  regarding the development of substance use which in turn will allow scientist  to investigate interventions and prevention programs that are most likely to be  successful.</p>

	<h3>Factors in Human Aging  (FHA)</h3>

<p>The Factors in Human Aging study, conducted by Dr. Colleen Jackson-Cook of the  Department of Pathology at Virginia Commonwealth University, studies how aging is effected by genes and environmental influences. As we age, a small  number of our cells go through chromosomal changes. Chromosomes are the  structures that contain our genetic information, known as DNA. The causes of  these changes are not currently known but by studying DNA researchers are  hoping to answer many questions about aging such as: Why do some people age  faster than others? And can we identify factors that might slow down the  aging process? Studying traits in twins is one of the best ways to gain  insight into these questions, so the researchers are collecting DNA from nearly 500 twins to learn more about the aging process.</p>

<p>For this study twins fill out a health questionnaire and provide a blood sample by visiting their doctor’s office. Dr. Jackson-Cook then analyzes the survey responses and genetic samples looking for key factors that change as people age over time.</p>
