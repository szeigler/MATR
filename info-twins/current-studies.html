<h1>Current Studies</h1>

		<p>Twins needed! The following list of studies is actively recruiting twins to participate in their research. If you are interested, please contact the MATR for more information!</p>

	<h2>Juvenile Anxiety Study (JAS)</h2>

		<p>Since 2013, the MATR has partnered with VCU researchers, Drs. John Hettema and Roxann Roberson-Nay to help understand the development of internalizing disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Internalizing disorders (IDs) can greatly reduce the quality of life of the individuals that are affected by them as well as their family and friends. Very little is known about why some individuals develop IDs and others do not. The MATR is currently inviting families with twins ages 9 through 13 years old to participate.  Studying twins in this age range is helpful because it allows the researchers to observe behaviors and collect basic data during a time of significant adolescent development, but before internalizing disorders are likely to be fully developed. The researchers are inviting twin pairs with and without signs of behaviors related to IDs to participate so they can learn more about the potential causes of these disorders. This study has the potential to not only provide a deeper understanding of the causes, but also to pioneer new ways in which doctors attempt to treat and prevent conditions like depression and anxiety.</p>
        
        <p>We are pleased with the willingness of families who have agreed to participate—over 100 families have signed up so far! Thank you so much to those who are a part of this study and have completed their study appointments!! We are looking forward to more families taking part because if a large number of families participate in this study, the researchers can make stronger conclusions about what influences the development of IDs. And, it’s these strong conclusions that allow the medical community to start new treatments and interventions to help improve the quality of life for those with depression and anxiety. If you’re interested in learning more about participating in this study click <a href="jas.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for some general study information. For those of you with twin pairs a bit further along in their teenage years, please see the information below about the <em>Adolescent and Young Adult Twin Study</em> (AYATS).</p>
        
  	<h2>ADOLESCENT &amp; YOUNG ADULT TWIN STUDY (AYATS)</h2>
    
    	<p>This study is similar to JAS in that it too is looking into factors that impact why certain individuals develop internalizing disorders, like anxiety and depression. For this study, Dr. Roberson-Nay is looking at a different, yet also significant developmental time period in a person’s life—that of the transition from adolescence into young adulthood. Perhaps during this time of intense change there are factors that may have increasing importance on a person’s risk to develop depression and anxiety at some point in their lives. Since both AYATS and JAS look at critical developmental periods they dovetail nicely and we are pleased to have both studies at VCU!</p>
        
        <p>The MATR has been recruiting families with older adolescent twins and young adult twins for about a year and half and are impressed and gratified with the willingness of the MATR families that have participated. Currently, the study is inviting families with twins 15 through 20 years old to participate. If you’re interested in learning more, click <a href="ayats.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for some general study information.</p>

	<h2>Mood and Immune Regulation in Twins (MIRT) Study</h2>
    
    	<img src="mirt_image.gif" id="mirt_img" alt="Mood and Immune Regulation in Twins Study icon" style="padding-right:1em; padding-top:.4em;" />
        
        <p>The MATR is continuing its collaboration with Dr. Briana Mezuk, of VCU’s Department of Family Medicine and Population Health. Dr. Mezuk hopes that her study, <em>Mood &amp; Immune Regulation in Twins</em> (MIRT), will allow her to better examine the relationships between environmental and biological factors that might be working together to influence the development of certain health conditions, particularly as people get older. Primarily, she is interested in how depressed mood and changes in the immune system interact to influence risk for developing type 2 diabetes, as well as the role environmental and genetic factors play in that risk. Dr. Mezuk and her colleagues hope that the results of this study will help researchers understand the links between mental and physical health as people age. Shedding light on these associations will hopefully one day allow the medical community to develop prevention and treatment plans that are more personalized to an individual’s specific biology. If you live within a couple of hours drive from Richmond, VA and are part of an identical twin pair (male or female) ages 40 through 70 years old, we may be contacting you soon by phone to tell you more about this study! If you’re interested in learning more about this study, click <a href="mirt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> to see the study advertisement.</p>
    
    <h2>EFFECT OF MULTIPLE FACTORS IN A BIOBEHAVIORAL STUDY OF DATING AMONG YOUNG WOMEN (EMBODY)</h2>
    
    	<p>Intimate or dating relationships can sometimes be stressful! Did you know that this can affect your health? More and more studies are showing a connection between some of the things that happen in intimate or dating relationships when we are younger and our health later on in life. Most of these studies have been done in young children and older adults, so Dr. Candace Burton and her colleagues at VCU are interested in focusing this question on the young adult period of development. They have partnered with the MATR to invite identical female twin pairs ages 18-20 in which at least one member of a pair has had a dating or intimate partner relationship in adolescence (between ages 11-18) to participate. The MATR has completed initial stages of recruitment with mailed items and is following up with some twins by phone. The study staff is working on enrolling twins that fit the study criteria. Thank you to those of you that have participated thus far!</p>
    
    <h2>Rheumatoid Arthritis Screener </h2>
    
    <img src="ra_image.jpg" id="ra_img" alt="x-ray of two hands" />

		<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful health condition that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States. Unfortunately, little is known about the causes of RA so researchers from New York University’s Hospital for Joint Disease have teamed with the MATR in hopes of learning more about RA, its causes and progression. To date, very few twin studies have been completed to investigate why some develop this oftentimes debilitating condition. Twin studies are helpful when looking at health conditions because they frequently help shed light on the gene--environment interactions that play a role in disease expression and progression. This study is particularly interested in the influence the intestinal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiota" target="_blank">microbiome</a> may be playing on the development of RA (as well as other autoimmune disorders, such as psoriatic arthritis). We will soon be actively recruiting for this study again and will update details at that time.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you to those who have already participated in the RA Screeners as well as those that have gone on to complete the study itself!</p>
        
	<h2>Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry Survey</h2>
		
        <p>UPDATE—we have been updating this survey and working on developing it in a different software package. Please still let us know if you’re interested, but it may be a bit before you receive your email link to the survey. Thank you for your patience!</p>
        
        <p>Available to all interested adult MATR participants!</p>

		<p><em>What is it?</em><br/>
		The MATR has launched a new survey which will enrich our Registry as a potential resource for researchers. This survey will ask questions about your health habits, health conditions and demographic characteristics. It will also ask questions about your personality as well as your social and political attitudes.</p>

		<p><em>How is this different from other MATR surveys?</em><br/>
		For the first time we will be offering the option of taking this survey online! The survey and data will be housed on a secure server and you only need internet access to complete the survey.</p>

		<p><em>How do I get involved?</em><br/>
		To participate, you need to be a registered, adult twin (over 18) or other multiple in our Registry (if you're not yet registered but want to participate, feel free to contact us to register!). You can let us know you're interested in participating in the survey by sending us an email or calling us at 1-800-URA-TWIN and leaving a message for us on our voicemail. You can also click <a href="participate-now.html">HERE</a> to tell us you're interested. Feel free to let us know if you have any questions. Remember, as with all MATR related activities, participation is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Plus, you do not have to answer any question that you're not comfortable answering!</p>

		<p><em>How will my participation help?</em><br/>
		Though you may not benefit directly from taking part, your participation will hopefully result in improving our understanding of certain health conditions and behaviors. We hope that with this improved understanding the scientific community will be better equipped to develop enhanced prevention methods and treatment plans.</p>

<h1>Data Analysis Studies</h1>

		<p>The following studies are no longer actively recruiting, but are currently in the data analysis phase. A big thanks to all the twins who participated!</p>

	<h2>THE GENETICS & EPIGENETICS* OF HEALTHY AGING IN TWINS</h2>
    
    	<p>Have you ever wondered why some individuals seem to feel and show the impact of aging more than others? Dr. Sangkyu Kim, a researcher at Tulane University in New Orleans, LA who studies aging, asked this same question and partnered with the MATR to see if MATR twins would be willing to participate in a study to help answer this question. Dr. Kim is particularly interested in studying the epigenetic differences between twins. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">Epigenetic</a> factors regulate how our genes are expressed as traits and very likely play a role in our quality of aging. For example, some of the choices we make throughout life, regarding exercise, diet, substance use, etc, may play a role in turning on and off certain genes. Some of these genes may be “aging genes” or ones that influence age-related health conditions. If these types of genes are turned on or off too soon or too late by an epigenetic factor, then our quality of aging may be impacted.</p>
        
        <p>The MATR recently completed recruitment efforts for this study and now the Principal Investigator and his team are starting the analysis phase of this research. For this study, the MATR invited same-sex twin pairs ages 65 or older to participate in the study. We were thrilled with the level of response and commitment demonstrated by our twins. Thank you very much to all those who are already part of the GHA study!</p>
        
        <p>*If you want to know more about the fascinating topic of epigenetics, we recommend PBS’s <em>NOVA Science Now</em> episode on the topic—click <a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/1525107473/" target="_blank">here</a> to access the video (the video clips can also be found on YouTube by searching <em>Nova Science Now and Epigenetics</em>). Though this video does not cover research conducted with MATR twins, it does reference a twin study, based out of Madrid, Spain, that investigates epigenetic changes in identical twins.</p>

    
    <h2>The	vaginal microbiome: disease, genetics, and the environment.</h2>

		<p><em>(This study is part of the <a href="http://hmpdacc.org/" target="_blank">Human Microbiome Project (HMP)</a>)</em></p>

		<p>Our bodies carry around trillions of microbes--bacteria, viruses, and other living things so tiny that we need a powerful microscope to see them. These microbes live in groups in many places on and inside our bodies, such as the skin, the  mouth, nose, gut and (in women) the vagina. While we still don’t know how they do it, many of these microbes help to keep us healthy, while others contribute  to disease. Similarly, changes in our health can affect our microbes. So can  things like where we live or work, our age, ancestry, health status, and diet—and probably many other things that we don’t know about yet.</p>

		<p>People and microbes both have DNA, the material that contains genetic instructions. The microbes’ DNA affects how they live with each other and how they act in our bodies. Our own DNA affects how we react to our microbes. All of the different kinds of microbes that live on and inside us, taken together, are called the “human microbiome.” The purpose of the HMP study is to learn about the human microbiome by studying the microbes’ DNA, other chemicals that the microbes produce, human DNA, and how microbes interact with each other and  with their human host to contribute to health and disease.</p>

		<p>In this particular study the researchers are focusing  on the microbes that live in specific parts of the body: the mouth, vagina, and perianal region. They collected samples from these areas; some from people who have certain diseases as well as from people who did not. By comparing the microbes found in these two sets of samples, and by making the information that learned available to other research scientists, they hope to gradually begin to understand more about the complicated relationships between the microbes that live in these areas of the body and certain diseases.</p>
        
        <p>The MATR invited identical and fraternal female twin pairs ages 18 and over to participate in this study. The VCU site of this study was one of the few with a twin component which means producing data that may provide better insight in the genetic and environmental factors influencing microbiome development.</p>

	<h2>IMPLICIT SUBSTANCE USE ATTITUDES ONLINE SURVEY FOR ADOLESCENT TWINS &amp; NON-TWIN SIBLINGS</h2>
    
    	<p>VCU Researchers, Drs. Neale and Verhulst developed an innovative online survey to help understand what influences adolescents in their decisions regarding substance use. The MATR contacted parents of juvenile twins that were between the ages of 12 and 17 years and invited their twins as well as any non-twin siblings of the same age range to participate in this online survey. The data from this survey was used to help test the survey method as well as to produce preliminary data that was used to determine feasibility of a larger survey effort. The researchers are using this information to develop proposals for grant funding applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Genes Environment and Development Initiative (GEDI)</h2>

		<p>The first phase for Drs. Eaves’ and Silberg’s "Genes, Environment and the  Development of Substance Use" study is almost complete. This study is part of a multi-site project called the Genes, Environment and Development Initiative (GEDI) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Participants from several study sites, including the MATR, have provided  samples from which genetic material will be analyzed.</p>

		<p>Investigators will conduct "genotyping" (determining the genetic make up) of the samples they’ve received for their analysis. Through their analysis the researchers are hoping to determine which genes and/or combination of genes most likely play a role in whether or not an individual may develop substance use issues. There is also evidence to suggest that at different developmental periods (childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood) there are differing likelihoods that an individual might develop substance use issues. Keeping this in mind, ultimately the researchers hope to answer <em>which </em>genes, <em>which</em> environments, and <em>which</em> developmental transitions together predict the start and progression for <em>which</em> type of drug abuse an individual might be susceptible to. While this research will take several years to complete, in the end we hope to gain a better understanding  regarding the development of substance use which in turn will allow scientist to investigate interventions and prevention programs that are most likely to be  successful.</p>

	<h2>Factors in Human Aging (FHA) &amp; CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY</h2>

		<p>The Factors in Human Aging study, conducted by Dr. Colleen Jackson-Cook of the Department of Pathology at Virginia Commonwealth University, studies how aging is effected by genes and environmental influences. As we age, a small number of our cells go through chromosomal changes. Chromosomes are the structures that contain our genetic information, known as DNA. The causes of these changes are not currently known but by studying DNA researchers are hoping to answer many questions about aging such as: Why do some people age faster than others? And can we identify factors that might slow down the  aging process? Studying traits in twins is one of the best ways to gain  insight into these questions, so the researchers are collecting DNA from nearly 500 twins to learn more about the aging process.</p>

		<p>For this study twins fill out a health questionnaire and provide a blood sample by visiting their doctor’s office. Dr. Jackson-Cook then analyzes the survey responses and genetic samples looking for key factors that change as people age over time. There is also a related study being conducted with Dr. Timothy York looking at the impact childhood adversity, such as abuse, has on health (NOTE: the MATR is no longer recruiting for this study, but the study may still be in the process of requesting items from participants).  Early results suggest that individuals that exposed to childhood adversity display more frequent chromosomal changes with age.  This can even be seen in identical twins (who have nearly the same DNA) when one member of the twin pair was exposed to childhood abuse while the other twin was not, or if one twin was exposed to the abuse more heavily than her co-twin.  There is also evidence to suggest that an individual’s childhood experiences may influence the types of chromosomal abnormalities that occur as a consequence of age.  These chromosomal changes may impact the health-related outcomes of a person as they age.</p>
